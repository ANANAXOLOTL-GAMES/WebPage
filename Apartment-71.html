                No one ever thought this place could be the scene of something so vile. Yet, like a sick twist of fate, the worst side of humanity has led me to a crime that happened here. Even as a cop, I wouldn’t have expected to link my life to this building with a tragedy.</br></br>
                I always liked strolling through the streets of Mexico City and watching the different buildings. This one apartment complex has always caught my attention, not only for its Modern and Brutalist architecture, but for its energy. There are many stories about the place, the majority are just for show, but I always felt like there was something pulling me towards it. Now, as if the building has been waiting for me to enter, my job brings me to this eerie scene.</br></br>
                The department calls it a murder-suicide; father kills his family and then takes his own life, though some bodies are still missing. Nonetheless, it seems sketchy; something feels odd about the whole ordeal and the department doesn’t want to keep investigating. The forensic team didn’t even arrive and the neighbors’ declarations seem too generic.</br></br>
                This case isn’t like the others I’ve worked on. I don't know if I'm projecting my fears and frustrations, or the fact that I've seen this place many times before is playing tricks in my head. This hunch is making it impossible to let it be another forgotten crime.</br></br>
                The system has a way to wear you down and I've been part of the problem, but not this time… I need to step into that apartment. Whatever's inside… It’s my duty to explore it. Even if nobody else is going to do something, I refuse to be an accomplice anymore.</br></br>
                I will solve this case, even if it costs me more than I can foresee.

            <p class="TextContent">

Missing bodies, scattered and scarce evidence; it all feels like</br> a rushed cover-up to this mess. Clearly they don’t have the intention to get involved in this situation.</br>
                But something is calling Gisela; she’s obsessing on why something like this would happen. A voice is gnawing at her, telling her that the apartment holds the answers. Is it her intuition or something darker?</br></br>

                Some truths have a price not many are willing to pay… Will Gisela be prepared to pay for them?</br>
